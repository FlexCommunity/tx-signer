# FAT Transaction Signer

FAT Transaction Signer is a simple JavaScript tool that empowers users to generate signed Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM) transactions directly on their client-side applications. This repository's primary goal is to make this
tool open-source and demonstrate transparency in the signature process. It provides a secure and user-friendly solution
for crafting and transmitting signed transactions to the FAT service.

## Client-Side Signing

Users can sign EVM transactions without the need to expose their private keys to external services, ensuring maximum
security.

## GitHub Hosting

FAT Transaction Signer is hosted on GitHub to further increase transparency.

## Enhanced Security

The EVM Transaction Signer employs robust cryptographic methods to safeguard users' private keys, guaranteeing that this
sensitive information never leaves their computer.
